title: Types of Resources on CFRCR
description: The different types of resources that are hosted on CFRCR.
---
There are currently three types of content hosted on CFRCR: __documents__, __terms__, and __collections__.

## Documents
Documents are single pages of infomation, organized by folder, accessible [here](/documents/). They usually contain information on one particular thing.

## Terms
Terms are explanations of words or phrases, found in the [glossary](/glossary/). Terms in the glossary are organized by name rather than the title displayed. For example, "Jekyll Front Matter" is found under "F". If you are having trouble finding a term, there, you can always search for it in the top left. You can also often see terms in other CFRCR content like this: {% include term text="Git" path="git/git.md" %}. You can either mouse over them for a quick description or click through for the full explanation.

## Collections
Collections organize and combine resources both on and off of CFRCR. Besides standard collections, there are also __collection indices__.

### Standard Collections
Standard collections organize all types of resources into a linear progression. These are used for everything from tutorials
