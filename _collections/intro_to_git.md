{% include collection/custom_begin title="Collection Specific Content" %}
This is how you would add custom resources to the thing. You know, the thing stored in {% include term text="git" %}. Besides liquid includes, markdown (if the collection file ends with .md) works normally:
- Item
- Item
- Another Item

1. Thing 1
2. Thing 2
3. Etc...
# ALL CAPS!!!
